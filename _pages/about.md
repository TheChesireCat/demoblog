Hi! I'm Ankit Ramakrishnan and welcome to my blog. I'm a Computer Science Master's student at Northeastern University interested in Computational Social Science, Digital Humanitites and Art. On this blog you will find my various projects and attempts at documenting my journey through academia.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1]. Unfortunately it's way too over-powered for my needs. I might explore a different approach in the future.
