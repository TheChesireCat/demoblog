## Welcome to My Blog!

Hi! I'm Ankit Ramakrishnan, a Computer Science Master's student at Northeastern University with a keen interest in Software/System Design, Automation, Data Analysis, Computational Social Science, Digital Humanities, and Art. Through this blog, I aim to share my projects and document my journey through academia, life, careers and beyond.

I recently graduated with an M.S. in Computer Science from Khoury (Northeastern University), where I've been diving deep into topics such as Natural Language Processing, Algorithms, HCI and PL. Before this, I was at Vellore Institute of Technology in India, earning my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

### Professional Journey

My career has been a rewarding journey through various roles and industries. 

~When does a photon ever ask about the road not taken?~

As a **Teaching Assistant** at Northeastern University, I've contributed to courses in Natural Language Processing and Algorithms.

Prior to my academic tenure, I embarked on a **Research Co-Op** at the Network Science Institute, where I worked under the guidance of Matteo Chinazzi on COVID geospatial mobility data analysis using GCP and Hadoop technologies.

Before coming to the US I worked at **HSBC Technology**, where I served as a Senior Software Engineer. Here, my role was mostly analyzing platform architectures and implementing solutions with a variety of DevOps tooling.

### Projects and Contributions

I've had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects that span across different domains of computer science:

- **Slapscape**: A full-stack geo-located image sharing social network application.
- **TASTY**: A Transformer-based approach for predicting the time and space complexity of code snippets, published and presented at the ICLR 2023 DL4C Workshop.
- **Visualizing Crime Incident Reports in Boston**: An innovative project that employs visualizations to analyze crime data.
- **Conversation Visualization**: A platform for visualizing conversations on video conferencing platforms, designed with D3.js and C++.

An LLM thinks that _"these projects, among others, showcase my ability to blend technical proficiency with creative problem-solving"_ and I suppose I agree.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)**, a blogging platform that supports Jupyter notebooks among other formats. As my journey evolves, so too may the platform. I was thinking of building a Static Site Generator but maybe using Next.js would be easier since I already know it. I'll choose to re-invent some other wheel.
