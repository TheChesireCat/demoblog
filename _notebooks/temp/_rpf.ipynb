    "We live in an age of computers where high-fidelity photorealism is only a renderfarm job away. Yet, the popularity of works like [Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, 2018](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/), [Klaus, 2019](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/)  and [Arcane, 2021](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/) show that Non-photorealistic Rendering is still alive and kicking. This psychedelic marraige of 2D and 3D rendering is exactly what excites me about animation. \n",

    "I've been interested in the cinematic quality of retro horror games like [Silent Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill) for a while now and wanted to make something quick and dirty someday. That got me thinking. When I was much younger I was obsessed with [Need For Speed Most Wanted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2005_video_game)). For a 2005 game NFS:MW had really well made maps. Maps large enough to base entire stories in.\n",
